# My Github pages

This is a place to store my stray thoughts in the form of write-ups, so that I may remember the strange hurdles
I've encountered along the way.  
I try to write them to be interesting enough.

## This page

Constructed in `Rust` with `Yew`, as with all things in my free time I make things more complicated than they need be.  
Except for the actual content, I pulled in a Markdown renderer so that I don't have to do so much web-work.  
I did also add some highlighting using [highlightjs](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js).

All page content except for some glue is just rendered markdown contained in the repo.
