# Table of contents

Because I'm terrible at web-dev and unable to make a side menu scale properly,
I made things easier for myself and made navigation happen through this md-page instead.

## Top level navigation

- [Home(also top left on this page)](/)
- [Table of contents(here, nothing will happen)](/table-of-contents)

## Projects
