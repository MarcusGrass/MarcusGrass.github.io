# My Github pages

This is a place to store my stray thoughts in the form of write-ups, so that I might remember the strange things
I've encountered along the way.  
I'll try to write them to be interesting enough.

## This page

There's not supposed to be a web 1.0 vibe to it, but I'm horrible at front-end styling so here we are.  
The site is coonstructed in [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) with [Yew](https://yew.rs/),
as with all things in my free time I make things more complicated than they need to be.  
Except for the actual content, I pulled in a Markdown renderer so that I don't have to do so much web-work.  
I did also add some highlighting using [highlightjs](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js).

All page content except for some glue is just rendered markdown contained
in [the repo](https://github.com/MarcusGrass/marcusgrass.github.io).
