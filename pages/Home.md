# About

This site is a place where I intend to store things I've learned so that I won't forget it.

## This page

There's not supposed to be a web 1.0 vibe to it, but I'm horrible at front-end styling so here we are.  
The site is constructed in [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) with [Yew](https://yew.rs/),
as with all things in my free time I make things more complicated than they need to be.  
Except for the actual content, I pulled in a Markdown renderer so that I don't have to do so much web-work.  
Additionally, the markdown styling is ripped from [this project](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css),
it's GitHub's markdown CSS, I don't want to stray too far out of my comfort zone...

All page content except for some glue is just rendered markdown contained
in [the repo](https://github.com/MarcusGrass/marcusgrass.github.io).

## Content

See the menu bar at the top left to navigate, if I end up writing a lot of stuff here I'm going to have to look into
better navigation and search.
